Assumptions and Constraints
=============================

Assumptions
-------------

State the assumptions associated with development of the system, where assumptions are defined
as future situations, beyond the control of the project, whose outcomes influence the success of a
project. The following are examples of assumptions:

* Availability of a hardware/software platform
* Pending legislation
* Court decisions that have not been rendered
* Future trends in immigration and naturalization
* Developments in technology

Constraints
-------------

State the constraints associated with the development of the system, where constraints are
defined as conditions outside the control of the project that limit the design alternatives.
Constraints can be broadly categorized as technical and non-technical. The following are
examples of both types of constraints:

* Government regulations
* Technical standards imposed on the solution (for example, the use of a specific Database
  Management System)
* Strategic decisions

Distinguish constraints from preferences, as follows:

* Constraints exist because of real business conditions. For example, a delivery date is a
  constraint only if there are real business consequences that will happen as a result of not
  meeting the date. If failing to have the subject application operational by the specified date
  places the FNS in legal default, the date is a constraint.
* Preferences are arbitrary. For example, a date chosen arbitrarily is a preference. Preferences,
  if included in the SRS, should be noted as such.
