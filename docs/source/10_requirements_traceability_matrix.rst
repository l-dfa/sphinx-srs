Requirements traceability matrix
=================================

When preparing an SRS, during the Requirements Definition Phase, also, create an initial RTM.
Provide the initial RTM as a standalone document. Requirements and their unique identifiers
appearing in the body of the SRS must appear verbatim in the RTM. The other significant
column of the RTM at this stage of its development is the source of the requirement, which for
the most part would come from the associated ConOps. Additionally, every requirement entry in
the RTM must be identified with its source.
