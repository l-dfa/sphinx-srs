Context
========================

Provide a context diagram of the system, with explanations as applicable. The context of a
system being developed refers to the connections and relationships between the system and the
outside world. Context Diagrams are often used to illustrate these connections and relationships.
Exhibit 1-1 illustrates a generic context diagram. If users interact with this system, user
interfaces must be shown explicitly in the context diagram.
