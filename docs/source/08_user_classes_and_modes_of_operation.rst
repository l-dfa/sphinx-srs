User Classes and Modes of Operation
=====================================

Classes/Categories of Users
----------------------------

Identify and describe the major classes/categories of users that will interact with the system (or
capability).

User Classes Mapped to Functional Features
-------------------------------------------

In this section provide an explanation of what functions each user organization can access or use.
Define any variations in the user work process that correspond to the use of the system by the
different classes of users.

Operational Scenarios
-------------------------

Develop sample usage scenarios for each major user class that show what inputs will initiate the
system functions, system interactions, and what outputs are expected to be generated by the
system. The scenarios should be comprehensive, to the extent that all user types and all major
functions are covered.
