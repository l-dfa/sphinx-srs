Functional Requirements
========================

The functional requirements describe the core functionality of the application. This section
includes the data and functional process requirements. Generally, the ConOps is the source for
specified or derived requirements.

Functional Process Requirements
---------------------------------

Process requirements describe what the application must do. Process requirements relate the
entities and attributes from the data requirements to the users’ needs.

State the functional process requirements in a manner that enables the reader to see broad
concepts decomposed into layers of increasing detail.

Requirement Statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The requirements must be phrased with the definitive word “shall” and have a unique number for
reference purposes. Each requirement and its identifier must be in a separated paragraph,
i.e., one “shall” per paragraph. See also Section 10 of this document. The on-line RequisitePro
FNS Template contains the standard formatting for requirements numbers, including prefixes.

Requirement Cross-Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Identification in text

identification in table

Process requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Process requirements may be supplemented with data flow diagrams, text, or any technique that
provides the following information about the processes performed by the application:

* Context
* Detailed view of the processes, including:

  * Data (attributes) input to and output (including reports) from processes
  * High-level logic used inside the processes to manipulate data (do not state "how")
  * Accesses to stored data
  
Illustrate the high-level functions of the system in a “level 0” diagram.
Exhibit D1-5 depicts an example of a level-0 diagram.

Caution: The major functions must match those identified in the Level-0 diagram.

Function “N”
-------------

Provide the requirements for each function of the system, adding subsections (e.g., 4.2, 4.3, etc.)
as needed and as described in Section 4.
