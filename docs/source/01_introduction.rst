Introduction
========================

The System Requirements Specification (SRS) is a formal statement of the application functional
and operational requirements. It serves as a contract between the developer and the customer for
whom the system is being developed. The developers agree to provide the capabilities specified.
The client agrees to find the product satisfactory if it provides the capabilities specified in the
SRS.

Sections 1 through 9 describe the contents of the SRS in accordance with the software
development life cycle (SDLC). Section 10 is provided for informational purposes only and
describes the general requirements for generating a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) in
tandem with the SRS. It provides general guidelines for writing requirements. Section 11
provides information on optional Attachments and Appendices.
