Data Requirements
========================

Describe the data requirements by providing data entities, their decomposition, and their
definitions. The data requirements describe the business data needed by the application system.
Data requirements do not describe the physical database and they are not at the level of
identifying field names. For this purpose, a data dictionary should be provided, showing data
entities, their attributes, and description. Refer to Section 4.1 for guidelines on formatting
requirements in tables.
