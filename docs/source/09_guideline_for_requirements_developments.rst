Guideline for requirements developments
==========================================

The following subsections are not components of the SRS. They are given here as guidelines for
developing requirements.

Criteria for Good Requirement
------------------------------

Good requirements are necessary for the development of systems that satisfy user expectations.

Good requirements support clear design, development, and test procedures. A good requirement
has several important characteristics, as described herein. These criteria for good quality
requirements are based on the IEEE Std 830, Recommended Practice for Software Requirements
Specifications, dated November 1998, and are described herein.

Unambiguous
-----------------

It has only one interpretation. It avoids technical jargon. If specific technological terms are
required for clarity, they must be defined in the requirement.

Complete
------------

It contains all information needed to write software for the requirement that is acceptable to the
customer. It does not contain the phrase “to be determined” (TBD) unless it is accompanied by a
description of the conditions required for its elimination, as well as a specification of who is
responsible for its elimination.

Correct
-------------

It adequately reflects the desired software function and performance.

Consistent
----------------

It does not conflict with other requirements within the same system or related systems. It agrees
with requirements defined in higher-level system documentation.

Verifiable
-----------------

It can be tested and confirmed.

Appropriate
---------------

It adds value to an organization by improving its process. It is within the scope of the current
statement of work.

Implementation Independent
-----------------------------

It can be satisfied by more than one design and implementation. It does not mention specific
hardware or software.

Achievable
---------------

It can be implemented within project time and budget constraints using available technology.

Written in a Consistent Format
---------------------------------

It begins with “The system shall….” Multiple sentences are phrased, “The system shall also….”
(It is preferable that each requirement be stated in its own paragraph, i.e., one “shall” statement
per paragraph.)

Concise
------------------

It describes a single need. It is as short as possible without adversely impacting
understandability.

Ranked for Importance
------------------------

It has an identifier to distinguish it in a document and for reference purposes.
